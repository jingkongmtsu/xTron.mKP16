\chapter{SCF Module}

SCF module is divided into two classes. One is SCF class, which is used to 
monitor practical SCF calculation process. The other one is SCFDeriv class,
this class is used to monitor the SCF derivatives calculation based on 
given molecular orbitals.

\section{SCF Class}

\subsection{Data Member of SCF Class}



\subsection{General SCF Procedure}

\begin{itemize}
 1 pre-calculation for scf;
 2 get the guess density matrices;
 3 begin scf loop;
   3.1 form Fock matrix;
   3.2 start convergence check; and update Fock matrix;
   3.3 form MO based on the final Fock;
   3.4 if SCF continue; form new density matrix; else stock the final MO
 4 possible post-processing for scf;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Member Class, Member Data and Member Functions Design Principle}

principle:  1  conceptually clear;  2  good memory management;  3 code clear
4 enough flexibility

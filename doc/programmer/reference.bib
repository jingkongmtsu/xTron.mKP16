  title = {Density Functional Theory -- an introduction},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods
	for ``ab initio'' calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules,
	crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary
	introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included
	in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented
	here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics,
	especially the idea of switching between different independent variables.
	The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and
	beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r)
	by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as
	a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform
	from the chemical potential (\mu) to the number of particles (N).
	This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy
	functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical
	nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic
	systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived.
	The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including
	both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact
	expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief
	survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to advocate the usefulness of the spin-density-functional
	(SDF) formalism. The generalization of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham scheme
	to and SDF formalism is presented in its thermodynamic version. The
	ground-state formalism is extended to more general Hamiltonians and
	to the lowest excited state of each symmetry. A relation between
	the exchange-correlation functional and the pair correlation function
	is derived. It is used for the interpretation of approximate versions
	of the theory, in particular the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation,
	which is formally valid only in the limit of slow and weak spatial
	variation in the density. It is shown, however, to give good account
	for the exchange-correlation energy also in rather inhomogeneous
	situations, because only the spherical average of the exchange-correlation
	hole influences this energy, and because it fulfills the sum rule
	stating that this hole should contain only one charge unit. A further
	advantage of the LSD approximation is that it can be systematically
	improved. Calculations on the homogeneous spin-polarized electron
	liquid are reported on. These calculations provide data in the form
	of interpolation formulas for the exchange-correlation energy and
	potentials, to be used in the LSD approximation. The ground-state
	properties are obtained from the Galitskii-Migdal formula, which
	relates the total energy to the one-electron spectrum, obtained with
	a dynamical self-energy. The self-energy is calculated in an electron-plasmon
	model where the electron is assumed to couple to one single mode.
	The potential for excited states is obtained by identifying the quasiparticle
	peak in the spectrum. Correlation is found to significantly weaken
	the spin dependence of the potentials, compared with the result in
	the Hartree-Fock approximation. Charge and spin response functions
	are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. Correlation is found
	to be very important for properties which involve a change in the
	spinpolarization. For atoms, molecules, and solids the usefulness
	of the SDF formalism is discussed. In order to explore the range
	of applicability, a few applications of the LSD approximation are
	made on systems for which accurate solutions exist. The calculated
	ionization potentials, affinities, and excitation energies for atoms
	propose that the valence electrons are fairly well described, a typical
	error in the ionization energy being 1/2 eV. The exchange-correlation
	holes of two-electron ions are discussed. An application to the hydrogen
	molecule, using a minimum basis set, shows that the LSD approximation
	gives good results for the energy curve for all separations studied,
	in contrast to the spin-independent local approximation. In particular,
	the error in the binding energy is only 0.1 eV, and bond breaking
	is properly described. For solids, the SDF formalism provides a framework
	for band models of magnetism. An estimate of the splitting between
	spin-up and spin-down energy bands of a ferromagnetic transition
	metal shows that the LSD approximation gives a correction of the
	correct sign and order of magnitude to published Xα results. To stimulate
	further use of the SDF formalism in the LSD approximation, the paper
	is self-contained and describes the necessary formulas and input
	data for the potentials.},

  abstract = {The exact exchange-correlation functional Exc[n] must be approximated
	in density-functional theory for the computation of electronic properties.
	By the coupling-constant integration (adiabatic-connection) formula
	we know that Exc[n]=F01(Veeα[n]-U[n])dα, where Veeα[n] is the electron-electron
	repulsion energy of Ψnmin,α, which is that wave function that yields
	the density n and minimizes 〈T^+αV^ee〉. Here α is the coupling constant.
	Consequently, knowledge of the behavior of Veeα[n] as a function
	of α ensures knowledge of Exc[n]. With this in mind and for the purpose
	of approximating Exc, it was previously established that (∂Veeα/∂α)≤0.
	The present paper reveals that Veeα[n]=αVee1[n1/α], where nβ(x,y,z)=β3n(βx,βy,βz),
	and where β is a coordinate scale factor.
	
	
	In other words, knowledge of Vee1[n] implies knowledge of Veeα[n]
	for all α. Alternatively, knowledge of Veeα[n] for some small α implies
	knowledge of all of the Veeα[n]. In any case, any viable approximation
	to Veeα[n] should be made to satisfy the above displayed equality.
	Analogous conclusions hold for the second-order density matrix, the
	pair-correlation function, the exchange-correlation hole, and the
	correlation component of the exchange-correlation hole, etc. For
	example, ρxc([n,α];r1,r2)=α3ρxc([n1/α,1]; αr1,αr2), where ρxc([n,α];
	r1,r2) is the exact exchange-correlation hole of Ψnmin,α.
	
	
	(A corresponding expression holds for the correlation hole alone.)
	Further, when n belongs to a noninteracting ground state that is
	nondegenerate, then limα→0 Veeα[n]=A[n]+fn(α)B[n]+..., where fn(α)
	must vanish at least as rapidly as α, and limλ→∞ Ec[nλ]>-∞, where
	Ec[n]=Exc[n]- limγ→∞ γ-1Exc[nγ], and where Ec is a familiar exact
	density-functional ‘‘correlation energy.’’ In contrast, in the local-density
	approximation and in certain nonlocal approximations, fn(α) is replaced
	by a function that goes as α[ln(α-1)], α→0, and Ec is replaced by
	a functional that is unbounded as λ→∞. Further, limλ→∞ Exc[nλx]>-∞
	and limλ→∞ Ex[nλx]>-∞, which are also not generally satisfied by
	common approximations. Here nλx(x,y,z)=λn(λx,y,z) and Ex is a familiar
	exact density-functional ‘‘exchange energy.’’ Finally, comparison
	is made between Ec and the traditional quantum-mechanical correlation
	energy, which is expressed exactly as a functional of the Hartree-Fock
	density.},

  abstract = {The results of a systematic study of molecular properties by density
	functional theory (DFT) are presented and discussed. Equilibrium
	geometries, dipole moments, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and
	atomization energies were calculated for a set of 32 small neutral
	molecules by six different local and gradient-corrected DFT methods,
	and also by the ab initio methods Hartree–Fock, second-order Møller–Plesset,
	and quadratic configuration interaction with single and double substitutions
	(QCISD). The standard 6-31G* basis set was used for orbital expansion,
	and self-consistent Kohn–Sham orbitals were obtained by all DFT methods,
	without employing any auxiliary fitting techniques. Comparison with
	experimental results shows the density functional geometries and
	dipole moments to be generally no better than or inferior to those
	predicted by the conventional ab initio methods with this particular
	basis set. The density functional vibrational frequencies compare
	favorably with the ab initio results, while for atomization energies,
	two of the DFT methods give excellent agreement with experiment and
	are clearly superior to all other methods considered.},

	limited flexibility of these first-principles LMFs and some basic

	term in rs-1 is the energy of a body-centered cubic lattice of electrons
	as calculated by Fuchs; the rs-3 / 2 term is the zero-point vibrational
	energy of the lattice, as obtained from a calculation of the normal
	modes, the result differing only by a small amount from the values
	estimated by Wigner; and brs-2 is the first-order effect of anharmonicities
	in the vibration. The constant b has been estimated, its magnitude
	being smaller than unity.
	
	
	The vibrational part of the specific heat has been calculated, and
	a first-order approximation has been obtained for the exponential
	terms in the energy. Part of this energy comes from exchange, which
	leads to the result that, except for very low densities (rs≳270),
	the electron spins are antiferromagnetically aligned. An order of
	magnitude for the Néel temperature has been calculated.},

	The value of the coefficient of rslnrs is evaluated, and it is found
	to differ from the value obtained by DuBois. The result of the present

	of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable
	when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires
	a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by
	Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming
	a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region
	of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed
	to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume
	(2&#960;h)3, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this
	model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to
	be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and
	one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of
	electric charge there.},

  abstract = {By the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, the density n(r) of many electrons
	in the presence of external potential v(r) obeys the relationships
	Fd3r n(r)∇v(r)=0 and Fd3r n(r)r×∇v(r)=0. By the virial theorem, the
	interacting kinetic and electron-electron repulsion expectation values
	obey 2T[n]+Vee[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇[δT/δn(r)+δVee/δn(r)]. The exchange
	energy functional Ex[n] and potential vx([n];r)≡δEx/δn(r) must satisfy
	Ex[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vx([n];r)=0, while the correlation energy and potential
	must satisfy Ec[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)<0. Somewhat counterintuitively,
	it is not true that T[nγ]=γ2T[n] and Vee[nγ]=γVee[n], where nγ(r)≡γ3n(γr)
	is a scaled density with scale factor γ≠1. In fact, it is impossible
	to partition the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional into a piece that
	scales as γ2 and a piece that scales as γ, even if complete freedom
	with the partitioning is allowed. Instead there are universal scaling
	inequalities.
	
	
	For instance, T[nγ]+Vee[nγ]<γ2T[n]+ γVee[n] and T[nγ]+γVee[nγ]>γ2(T[n
	]+Vee[n]), and consequent inequalities involving Ec[n]. All the above
	virial and scaling requisites are universal in that they are independent
	of external potential and they must hold for arbitrary proper n.
	In addition, for the ground-state energy (E) and n of any atom or
	molecule at its equilibrium nuclear configuration, there is the inequality
	E<-Ts[n], where Ts is the noninteracting kinetic energy. In the closed-shell
	tight-binding limit, the correlation potential obeys Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)=0,
	and so cannot be a monotonic function of r for an atom in this limit.
	
	
	Further, (∂/∂γ)Ec[nγ]‖γ=1=E c[n]+Tc[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r), which
	implies that the exact Ec should be fairly insensitive to scaling.
	With the help of the ionization-potential theorem, it is argued that
	the exact vc([n];r) in an atom often has a positive part. Common
	approximations to the correlation potential are examined for their
	effects upon the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy and the
	density moment 〈r2〉, and these effects are found to be related. Further
	improvements needed in the approximate correlation potentials are
	relatively large, but not nearly so large as those recently suggested
	for the atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe: The discrepancy between theoretical
	values of 〈r2〉 from Hartree-Fock or configuration-interaction calculations,
	and experimental values from measured diamagnetic susceptibilities,
	is tentatively resolved in favor of theory.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is the further systematic improvement of
	the accuracy of Double-Hybrid Density Functionals (DHDF) that add
	non-local electron correlation effects to a standard hybrid functional
	by second-order perturbation theory (S. Grimme{,} {,} 2006{,} {,}
	034108). The only known shortcoming of these generally highly accurate
	functionals is an underestimation of the long-range dispersion (van
	der Waals) interactions. To correct this deficiency{,} we add a previously
	developed empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) to the energy expression
	but leave the electronic part of the functional untouched. Results
	are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction energies{,}
	the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational energies of
	a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore propose
	seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular dispersion
	contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density functionals.
	In general{,} the proposed composite approach is for many chemically
	relevant properties of similar quality as high-level coupled-cluster
	treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for non-covalent
	interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF provides one
	of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) for the
	S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol). Unprecedented high accuracy is also obtained
	for the relative energies of peptide conformations that turn out
	to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for the
	G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol) underline
	the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large molecules.
	In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP approach
	are also significantly improved{,} and we recommend the general use
	of dispersion corrections in DFT treatments.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the Hartree-Fock equations can be regarded as ordinary
	Schrödinger equations for the motion of electrons, each electron
	moving in a slightly different potential field, which is computed
	by electrostatics from all the charges of the system, positive and
	negative, corrected by the removal of an exchange charge, equal in
	magnitude to one electron, surrounding the electron whose motion
	is being investigated. By forming a weighted mean of the exchange
	charges, weighted and averaged over the various electronic wave functions
	at a given point of space, we set up an average potential field in
	which we can consider all of the electrons to move, thus leading
	to a great simplification of the Hartree-Fock method, and bringing
	it into agreement with the usual band picture of solids, in which
	all electron are assumed to move in the same field. We can further
	replace the average exchange charge by the corresponding value which
	we should have in a free-electron gas whose local density is equal
	to the density of actual charge at the position in question; this
	results in a very simple expression for the average potential field,
	which still behaves qualitatively like that of the Hartree-Fock method.
	This simplified field is being applied to problems in atomic structure,
	with satisfactory results, and is adapted as well to problems of
	molecules and solids.},

	complete systems of functions can be constructed appropriate to any
	molecular problem, and that all the necessary integrals can be explicitly
	evaluated. These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital
	method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating
	linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational
	procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions
	converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that
	the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required
	degree of accuracy is the labour of computation. A modification of
	the general method applicable to atoms is discussed and considered

	excited states of sizable molecular systems. In this article, we
	report an assessment of the performance of SOS-CIS(D0) for adiabatic
	electronic transition energies and excited state equilibrium geometries
	for various small molecules. These tests allow optimization of the
	empirical scaling parameter in SOS-CIS(D0), and it is shown that
	one universal scaling parameter (chosen as 1.4) can satisfactorily
	reproduce the experimental results for all the tested molecules.
	The method is then applied to examine the large Stokes shift observed
	with a dihydrosilaphenanthrene derivative. The main features of the
	experimental absorption and emission spectra of this molecule are
	well reproduced by SOS-CIS(D0). },

  abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis
	for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
	In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method
	have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure.
	The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly
	those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise
	from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while
	normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper
	treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a
	physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences
	in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms
	are always important, although the formulation of a simple method
	for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring
	higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena),
	where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the
	Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization
	terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the
	perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms
	can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown
	that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization
	and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude
	for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time
	t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization
	provides a complete description of the physical properties of the
	system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and
	phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation
	expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational
	applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast
	to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent
	perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general
	development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator
	and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary
	quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of
	an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic
	theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed
	eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall
	phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate
	for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact
	expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities
	in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations
	are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise
	when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application
	of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other
	methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization
	terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure
	and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of
	secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be
	important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular
	and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational
	principles for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. By employing
	the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave
	function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms,
	a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained.
	This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system
	level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent
	to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions
	for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations
	are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the
	interactions of radiation and matter.},

  volume = {44},
  pages = {505-514},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {A detailed examination is made of several approximations to the first-order
	Hartree—Fock perturbation equation. Four distinct methods are considered:
	the coupled (Method a) and the uncoupled (Method c) approximation
	of Dalgarno, a new alternative uncoupled approximation (Method b),
	and the simplified uncoupled approximation of Karplus and Kolker
	(Method d). By a comparison of the pertinent equations, it is shown
	that Methods a, b, and d correspond to each other in the use of a
	core potential analogous to that appearing in the zeroth-order Hartree—Fock
	equation, while Method c differs due to the inclusion of an extraneous
	self-potential term. An alternative analysis based on an orbital
	basis set expansion of the perturbed function demonstrates that Method
	c has an energy denominator of the simple Hückel type, while both
	Methods a and b include important two-electron correction terms.
	Also, it is found that of the four approximations, only Method c
	can be obtained as the first-order correction with a zeroth-order
	many-electron Hamiltonian that has the Hartree—Fock determinant as
	its eigenfunction; the other techniques are one electron in character,
	as is the Hartree—Fock method itself.The significance of the difference
	in the core potential is demonstrated by test calculations of dipole
	and quadrupole polarizabilities and shielding factors for the two-,
	three-, and four-electron isoelectronic series. A variational technique
	is used with a trial function that has the form of a polynomial times
	the unperturbed orbital. For the polarizabilities, it is found that
	Method b is an excellent approximation to Method a, indicating that
	the self-consistency condition on the Method a solutions has a very
	small effect. The shielding factors, however, appear to be more sensitive
	to the self-consistency requirement. Both Method c and Method d introduce
	larger errors than Method b, with Method c particularly poor for
	three-electron atoms and ions. The constraint introduced by choice
	of trial function is shown to be unimportant for polarizabilities,
	but quite severe for the four-electron atom shielding factors.A comparison
	of the complexity of the various techniques shows that the relative
	computing times for Methods a, b, c, and d are in the ratio of 300
	to 60 to 75 to 1. Thus, Method d is simplest by far, although its
	speed is achieved by some loss of accuracy with respect to Methods
	a and b.},

  abstract = {A method for calculating the EPR g-tensor based on coupled perturbed
	Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) is presented.
	The one-electron molecular orbitals of a spin- unrestricted Slater
	determinant are calculated up to first order in the applied magnetic
	field. The g-tensor is evaluated as a mixed second derivative property
	with respect to the applied field and the electron magnetic moment.
	Thus, spin-polarization and spin–orbit coupling are simultaneously
	included in the calculation. The treatment focuses on orbitally nondegenerate
	molecules but is valid for a general ground state spin S and, for
	the first time, it is possible to include hybrid density functionals
	in the treatment. The relativistic mass and diamagnetic gauge corrections
	are also considered. An implementation of the theory is described.
	Extensive numerical calculations for a series of small molecules
	are reported with the Hartree–Fock (HF) method, the local density
	approximation (LSD), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
	and hybrid density functionals such as B3LYP and PBE0 and large Gaussian
	basis sets. Detailed comparison with available ab initio and DFT
	calculations are made. The results indicate that the hybrid functionals
	offer little or no improvement over the GGA functionals for small
	radicals made of light atoms. For transition metal complexes the
	situation is different. The hybrid functionals give, on average,
	better results than the GGA functionals but significant disagreement
	between theoretical and experimental g-shifts still remain. Overall,
	the results indicate that the present method is among the most accurate
	so far developed models for the prediction of g values.},

	applications are relatively rare. This article helps to fill the
	void by first giving a historical review of TDDFT, with emphasis
	on molecular excitations and aspects of TDDFT which are important
	for quantum chemical applications, followed by a discussion of some
	modern evolutions with emphasis on the articles in this volume, and
	ending with a few thoughts about the future of TDDFT.},

	functional response theory: Consistent formalism, implementation,
	and performance},

  abstract = {First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are key
	for phenomena such as nonradiative transitions and excited-state
	decay, yet a consistent and practical first principles treatment
	has been elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy atoms.
	Here we present theory, implementation using Gaussian basis sets,
	and benchmarks of first-order NACMEs between ground and excited states
	in the framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional theory
	(TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to NACMEs which avoids
	explicit computation of excited-state wave functions is outlined.
	In contrast to previous approaches, the present treatment produces
	exact analytical derivative couplings between time-dependent Kohn–Sham
	(TDKS) determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As in analytical
	gradient theory, derivative molecular orbital coefficients can be
	eliminated, making the computational cost independent of the number
	of nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to the exact
	Chernyak–Mukamel formula for first-order NACMEs in the complete basis-set
	limit, but greatly improves basis-set convergence in finite atom-centered
	basis sets due to additional Pulay type terms. The Chernyak–Mukamel
	formula is shown to be equivalent to the Hellmann–Feynman contribution
	in analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be implemented in
	TDDFT analytical excited-state gradient codes with minor modifications.
	Tests for systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of first-order
	NACMEs causes total computation times to increase by an insignificant
	10% on average. The resolution-of-the-identity approximation for
	the Coulomb energy (RI-J) reduces the computational cost by an order
	of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals, while errors are insignificant
	with standard auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs
	to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark results for
	diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI are found to be in agreement
	for regions of the potential energy curve where the Kohn–Sham ground-state
	reference is stable and the character of the excitation is properly
	captured by the present functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic
	molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems in the 100 atoms
	regime are within reach.},

* problem using intel compiler      *

*************************************
for using Intel compiler, we notice that the running time library for 
Intel fortran compiler has two versions, one is thread safe and the 
other one is thread unsafe. The thread safe one is libifcoremt,
the thread unsafe one is libifcore. For more information, please
see the post here:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/threading-fortran-applications-for-parallel-performance-on-multi-core-systems
search for the keyword of "Thread Safe Libraries".

For KP14 functional, if we do not use the thread safe library in multi-threads
env. it will give incorrect result. So you need to link against the libifcoremt
and use the -openmp for linking as well as -fopenmp for compiling with ifort.
However, it seems that we did not call FOR_RTL_INIT (see the above post), but 
somehow can get the correct result.

for PSTS functional, ifort just give wrong xc matrix number. No matter ifcore
or ifcoremt we use. currently ifort version is 17.0.2. Just disable the ifort use.

You should be caution about this!!

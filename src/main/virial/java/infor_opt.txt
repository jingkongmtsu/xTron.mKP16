#
#  this is the template file to set up the parameter opt for running emul (see ParamOpt)
#  here below is the keywords that ParamOpt supports
#

#  exchange functional, pw86x is the default one
#  exchange    pw86x

#  correlation functional, pbec is the default choice
# correlation  pbec

#  the first monomer name, either atom or molecule file name
mono1   Ne

#  the second monomer name, either atom or molecule file name
mono2   Ne

# opt method selection. Two choices you can select, one is scanning the curve,
# the other is to do single point calculation against the bottom well data
# default is single point calculation (single_point or scanning)
#opt   single_point

# in the method of scanning the curve, we need to know three things:
# 1  the starting distance between the two monomers,
# 2  the ending distance between two monomers;
# 3  step size for the scanning
# 1  and 2 will be got depending on the monomer type in the program,
# and 3 is given here
# step length is in default as 0.1
# distance_step   0.1

# in the program, the XDM parameters will be testing between the given range
# which determined by the "begin" and "end". XDM has two parameters, one
# is p1 and the other one is p2
# there's not default paramters for them, you have to specify them here below
xdm_p1_begin       1.00
xdm_p1_end          1.30
xdm_p2_begin       0.70
xdm_p2_end          1.40

# step length in scanning XDM parameters
# both p1 and p2 use the same step length
# default is  0.01, but you can set it as 0.1 for coarse scanning
xdm_step                0.1

# in the curve scanning method, if the calculate energy is approaching to zero,
# we need to determine that whether we need this energy result or not
# the ratio is defined as: abs(E)/bottom_well_energy
# is ratio <=standard_ratio below, then we think that the scanning should end
# 0.02 is the default value
# standard_ratio    0.02

# do you want to keep the generated input and output files for emul?
# in default it's true
# clean_file  true

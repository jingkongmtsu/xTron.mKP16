#
#  this is the template file to set up the parameters for curve scanning
#  after you get your optimized basis sets, xdm paramters;
#  you can run it to see what kind of curve it will produce 
#

#  exchange functional, pw86x is the default one
#  exchange    pw86x

#  correlation functional, pbec is the default choice
#  correlation  pbec

#  the first monomer name, either atom or molecule file name
mono1   Ne

#  the second monomer name, either atom or molecule file name
mono2   Ne

# in scanning the curve, we need to know three things:
# 1  the starting distance between the two monomers,
# 2  the ending distance between two monomers;
# 3  step size for the scanning
# step length is in default as 0.1
distance_begin    2.00
distance_end      9.00
# distance_step   0.1

#
# here you need to give the xdm parameters, they do not have
# any default value:
#
xdm1  1.1  
xdm2  1.08

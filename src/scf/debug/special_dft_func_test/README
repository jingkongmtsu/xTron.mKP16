this is the testing samples for special DFT functionals, namely
the functionals based on exchange energy density. 

Typically, these functionals need the first round SCF calculation
to generate a better density matrix, then it's SCF runs at the second
round.

Thse samples can be used to debug the functionals. Currently, functionals
testing in this folder include:
*  B05
*  B13 coorelational
*  B13
*  KP14

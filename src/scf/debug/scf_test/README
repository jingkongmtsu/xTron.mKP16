here we store some cases that by comparing with GAMESS,
we are not same. This may indicate that our code still have
some bug.

***  Li atom for HF calcualtion with G3LARGE basis set  ***
currently the core guess and the atomic guess both can not lead to 
correct SCF result. However, with also core guess GAMESS gives
the same SCF energy; which means we should revise our atomic guess.
For B3LYP calculation, we see the similar thing for the ch3ch2o,
also with G3large basis set. We believe both of the two cases
can be corrected through improvement of SCF guess method.

this piece of code is to use the matrix class etc. to compare the difference
between two given matrix data saved on hard disk.

to use this utility program, just type "make" here in this folder to compile
the code. Make sure that TBB, boost and lapack/blas library is installed.

the command line parameter is like this:

./matrix_compare in  out p1  p2  p3
in links to the input matrix where we can read in the molecule and shell data
out is the output file
p1 defines the path that links to the standard data matrix(from gints or xc)
p2 defines the path that links to the testing data matrix(must be xc)
p3 defines the path that links to the density matrix so that we can compute the energy
p3 is optional

see the code in main.cpp for more information

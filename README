This program, called xTron, has been developed at Jing Kong's group at
Middle Tennessee State University. The primary focus is to develop new
methods for density functional theory. The current code includes:

1. Computation of the Hartree-Fock exchange (HFX) energy density;
2. Computation of the HFX hole;
3. B05 and B13, KP16/B13 implementations.


The code was written mainly by Fenglai Liu with design input from Jing Kong.
Emil Proynov and Jing also help in coding. Yiting Wang wrote the code for the 
computation of HFX hole.

You need three external libraries: netlib, gsl and tbb.  Note that the 
most recent release of tbb will not work.  You need an older version, 
like released before 2020.  Also some fortran codes do not seem to pass the
latest gfortran either.

Please check bshrc.example to see the env's needed to compile and run xTron.
Once you set the env's correctly, you can go the top folder of xTron and
type 'perl configure.pl', and then go to build/, and type 'make'.  That
should be it.

The test folder includes a few examples. To run the code, simply type 
'xtron input output'.

Note that this README is very brief. I trust that a lot of stuff are 
self-explanatory to those who have code development experience on linux. 
But feel free to ask me if you have questions.


Note: This initial release of code is (very) experimental. Please feel free 
to contact me at jing.kong@mtsu.edu if you want to use it.  Your feedback 
will help us to improve it.


Below are functionalities unique to xTron.

Descriptions:

1. HFX energy density: halfjkrho.cpp, espints.cpp, batchexrhomtrx.cpp. The
HFX energy density is calculated in halfjkrho.cpp, which calls espints.cpp
for computing the electrostatic potential of a shell pair. This part of 
code eventually calls cppints on github, an efficient four-center integral
package developed by Fenglai. It is included in this distribution.
batchexrhomtrx.cpp is to construct the 
HFX-related part of XC matrix.

2. HFX hole: halfjkrho.cpp, gaussian.cpp, sphereInt.cpp, coefCalculator.cpp.
doHalfJKRhoXHole in halfjkrho.cpp calls sphereInt the computation of the HFX
hole value at a given interelectronic distance.

3. B05, B13, KP16/B13, mKP16/B13: All the Fortran files (*.f). Note that 
'kp14' was used internally for KP16 method because its implementation 
started in 2014.
